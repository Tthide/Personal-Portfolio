Passersby can still pick up or drop off regular books, but they also have the chance to interact with special art books. These books act as canvases for projected artworks, offering a tangible yet immersive way to experience local creativity. Interaction is further enriched through a hand-sized dice that lets users explore more information about the artworks and artists, express their feelings, and even connect to merchandise opportunities that support local artists financially.",

The course encouraged students to develop projects without restrictions on theme, technology, or impact, with the aim of animating and enriching public life in Seestadt (Vienna, Austria). Our team of four chose to support local artists, recognizing both the financial instability of the profession and its vital role in making communities more vibrant and livable. By showcasing art in Seestadt, we sought to bring soul and cultural identity to its newly built streets.",

The project also had to include technology and computers in some way (since it was part of a computer science curriculum) and also that interactions <strong>must</strong> be <em>tangible</em>. This of course gave us a lot of freedom to choose what we could do, but also made it seem like we would not be able to find a good enough theme or idea to start.</p><p>Design thinking is an infinite cycle between expanding the ideas we come up with, then focusing inward and delving deeper onto some of them, then once again expanding on the selected concepts by allowing ourselves more creative freedom before refocusing on a specific idea. I showcase this cycle with little converging/diverging icons on each step.</p><p>Here we were only at the beginning, so we did not restrain our imaginations in producing lots of ideas, many of which were not close to what we eventually did, but that perhaps could have influenced even in a small way our approach or our final design.</p>",

On my side, I primarily focused on art economics and the art market as a whole. Through this research, we found several promising ways to support artists financially, such as through merchandising or, to a lesser extent nowadays, NFTs. We also found that entering the traditional art market is tedious and that only a minority of living artists really profit from it.</p><p>It then became clear to us that this target group and our objective was promising, so we decided to keep it.</p>",

We circled around ideas of community workshops with tutorials projected onto canvases or material to help people hone their crafts, or around a way to <em>\"geocache\"</em> artworks around the city for a gamified way for people to discover local artists.</p><p>Eventually, we came up with an idea of an interactive digital street signage installation that would display art to everyone passing by. People stopping at our installations could vote or give their opinion on the art and eventually buy merchandise to support the artist.

We gathered more information by preparing and conducting several design methods:</p><ul><li>First, we each conducted interviews with experts in different domains involved in our current idea. The goal was to identify potential challenges, gather intel about the feasibility of our concept, and evaluate it. For instance, I interviewed the CEO of a Slovakian Digital Signage company, from whom I learned several important difficulties behind public digital signage. With these interviews, we narrowed down our design by integrating the information we gathered.</li><li>Next, we prepared and handed out <em>Cultural Probes</em> to local inhabitants of Seestadt. This allowed us to present our idea to people who would be affected by it, gaining direct feedback, and to collect information about their behaviors, preferences, and habits regarding art, art rating, and Seestadt itself.</li><li>Lastly, we created a tabletop game mimicking the rating interactions we were considering. We hosted games with inhabitants of the neighborhood and observed their behaviors to understand how the rating system impacted their perception of the art.</li></ul><p>Through these methods, we learned a lot about people's preferences, especially their habits in the neighborhood and their preferred way of rating art.

We went back to the drawing board, sketching interaction ideas while maintaining the core concept of a free little library with visual local art display and rating possibilities.</p><p>We developed the idea of 'special books' onto which local art would be projected. An additional tool or object could serve as a controller to enable further interactions. We considered pens (visually or magnetically tracked), ropes and pulleys, and finally decided on a hand-sized cube or dice to enable interactions.</p>",

Each face of the cube enabled a different interaction, for a total of six options, such as revealing more information, rating the artwork, or expressing feelings along an emotions circle.</li></ul><p>To refine the idea, we created a physical mock-up and a digital wireframe. Student testers highlighted issues like ergonomics (books needed to be readable and comfortable) and interaction clarity (special books and cubes are uncommon items). The tests also confirmed the concept's interestingness and that we were moving in the right direction.</p>",
