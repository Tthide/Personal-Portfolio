This of course gave us a lot of freedom to choose what we could do, but also made it seem like we would not be able to find a good enough theme or idea to start.</p><p>Design thinking is an infinite cycle between expanding the ideas we come up with, then focusing inward and delving deeper onto some of them, then once again expanding on the selected concepts by allowing ourselves more creative freedom before refocusing on a specific idea. I showcase this cycle with little converging/diverging icons on each step.</p><p>Here we were only at the beginning, so we did not restrain our imaginations in producing lots of ideas, many of which were not close to what we eventually did, but that perhaps could have influenced even in a small way our approach or our final design.</p>",

On my side, I primarily focused on art economics and the art market as a whole. Through this research, we found several promising ways to support artists financially, such as through merchandising or, to a lesser extent nowadays, NFTs.

Capturing people’s attention in this way is far harder than it seems. After this project, I spoke with more of them and gained even greater appreciation for their efforts.</p><p>Finally, as a UX designer and engineer, this project introduced me to the concept of iterative design, and I found myself enjoying it immensely. Of course, there are limitations to everything, and Design Thinking does not eliminate them. In particular, some people follow it strictly like a recipe, but I see it more as a toolbox of suggestions. Nevertheless, my approach to designing and managing projects through structured design phases has definitely evolved and been influenced by the principles of Design Thinking.</p><p><strong>This project has fundamentally shaped how I approach UX and engineering: iterative, empathetic, and adaptable to real user needs.</strong></p>"

Instead, it started as a purely abstract strategy game where the focus was entirely on mechanics. The playing field was designed as a collection of interconnected circles, each divided into multiple sections. Players would take turns coloring these sections with their chosen color.</p><p>The core rule of the game was simple: a player could color a section only if the circle was unclaimed or if they already controlled at least one section of it. Once all sections of a circle were filled by the same player, the circle was considered conquered. At that moment, a key mechanic, <em>propagation</em>, would be triggered: the player’s color spread into all directly connected circles. This propagation not only added a new colored section to neutral circles, but also replaced any sections already controlled by opponents, creating sudden and dramatic shifts in control.</p><p>This mechanic encouraged players to think several steps ahead. Choosing the right circle to conquer could cause chain reactions that flipped entire regions of the board, while a poorly timed move could set up an opponent for a devastating blow. Even without a theme, this early prototype already demonstrated the potential for deep strategy arising from very simple rules.</p><p>At this stage, the game was entirely about testing, refining, and balancing these mechanics. The thematic layer, civilizations battling for galactic dominance, was added later, but the abstract strategy roots remain at the heart of <strong>Node Wars</strong>.</p>",

A good way to achieve this was by choosing a theme for the game. A theme is one of the most obvious and visible aspects of a game, as it defines its visual identity and gives players a recognizable context to engage with.</p><p>In regard to the <strong>MDA (Mechanic-Dynamic-Aesthetic)</strong> framework, we already had the mechanics in place. Adding a theme to the game mostly impacts the aesthetic layer, rather than the core mechanics or dynamics. Therefore, many different topics could have worked with our core mechanic, especially given its network and graph-theory foundation, which lends itself to a wide range of domains.</p><p>The idea of space as a theme came naturally. When I was younger, I played <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Battlefront_II_(2005_video_game)' target='_blank'> <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005)</em></a> on the PS2, which included a Galactic Conquest mode.

Once the basic mechanics were in place, we focused on small quality-of-life updates and bug fixes to make the experience more polished and stable.</p><p>After reaching a playable prototype, we organized testing sessions with other players to gather early feedback. The game quickly became one of the favorites among those presented, with testers praising its strategic aspect, and the excitement of the propagation mechanic. Players found the chain-reaction system particularly satisfying, as it created unexpected yet logical swings in control.</p><p>However, the tests also revealed key areas for improvement. Some first-time players struggled to understand how propagation worked without explicit guidance. In addition, the initial map layout appeared slightly unbalanced, with the first player sometimes having a noticeable advantage. These insights helped define our next steps: improving onboarding, balancing gameplay, and finding ways to add more strategic depth.</p>",

The goal was to let players pursue different paths to victory and manage various aspects of the game simultaneously, leading to richer strategic decisions.</p><p><strong>The final three victory conditions were:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Domination Victory:</strong> Eliminate the other player by taking over all of their nodes using explosions.</li><li><strong>Path Victory:</strong> Be the first to move your UFO from the starting planet to the destination planet. Move the UFO by fully coloring the current planet of the path.</li><li><strong>Control Victory:</strong> Fully occupy the king planet with your color for as many turns in a row as indicated.</li></ul><p>These new objectives gave players freedom to adapt their strategies, focusing on aggressive expansion, tactical movement, or strategic control, making each match more varied and engaging.</p>",

                    "personal_reflection": "<p>Making a video game was always a dream of mine, and doing so was a very enriching experience. Through this project, I learned some fundamental aspects of game design. For example the MDA framework and how to predict how game mechanics, which is the aspect of the game the developer can most easily modify, impacts the player experience.</p><p>Another fundamental concept I learned through this project is one definition of what a game is.<strong> Games, whatever the type they are, follow three basic rules:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>They must have doable tasks.</strong> This doesn't mean that the game cannot be hard or complex — only that, at the end of the day, the game and its tasks should be possible to complete. For instance, running a marathon is hard for a random person, but it is doable even if it might take longer.</li><li><strong>The game must offer understandable feedback.</strong> The player should be able to interpret how well they are performing to have a better experience. In the marathon example, having other runners provide you relative feedback on your performance (\"are you better than others?\" since it’s a race) and distance markers showing your progress (\"how much farther do you have to run?\") are both examples of meaningful feedback.</li><li><strong>The game needs to take place in a safe environment.</strong> Otherwise, it shouldn't be considered a game. This principle means that games are defined by a kind of “magic” space where players can take risks, compete, or experience failure without suffering real-world consequences. Inside this boundary, players agree to follow a specific set of rules and to suspend certain real-world concerns for the sake of play.</li></ul>"
