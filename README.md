## About This Project
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase some of my projects, experiments, and reflections as a UX engineer. 
Built using Angular CLI v20.2.1, this project was an opportunity to explore Angular while also creating a space that represents my personal style.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
