#### process step 1

##### Ideation: the beginning ⚟

Our only initial instructions and starting point were that we eventually needed to include the following to our project: "sustainability, infrastructure, creativity and the neighborhood of Seestadt". The project also had to include technology and computers in some way (since it was part of a computer science curriculum) and also that interactions **must** be *tangible*. This of course gave us a lot of freedom to choose what we could do, but also made it seem like we would not be able to find a good enough theme or idea to start. 

Design thinking is a infinite cycle between expanding the ideas we come up with, to then focusing inward and delving deeper onto some of them, then once again expanding on the selected concepts by allowing ourself more creative freedom before refocusing on a specific idea. I showcase this cycle with little converging/diverging icons on each steps.

Here we were only at the beginning, so we did not restrain our imaginations in producing lots of ideas. Many of which were not close to what we eventually did, but that perhaps could have influenced even in a small way our approach or our final design.


#### process step 2

##### Ideation: is this even a good idea? ⚞

Eventually, we closed in on working or creating something that could benefit artists. Stereotypically, we had the vision that artists are people doing this work for the love of art and not of money, and that artist as a job was badly remunerated.

Of course, we quickly came across the need to actually check whether that cliché even held a semblance of truth or at the very least to what extent do artist need to be financially supported as well as investigating several ways on how to do that.

To do that, we each concluded a litterature research to find sources and arguments that could support (or disprove) our initial hypothesis that artists needed help financially, and how to provide that. On my side, I primarily focused on art economics and the art market as a whole. Through this research, we found several promising ways to support artist financially, such as through merchandising or, to a lesser extent nowadays, NFTs. We also found that getting into the traditional art market is tedious and that only a minority of (alive) artist are really profiting from it.

It then became clear to us that this target group and our objective was a promising one and we thus decided to keep it.

#### process step 3

##### Ideation: well... what do we build now ?  ⚟

One could say that there are countless forms of art, and while that is a beautiful sentiment, we couldn't find an idea that we liked that englobed all forms of art (while still respecting the few limitations we had). We circled around ideas of community workshops with tutorials that could be projected into canvas or material to help people hone their crafts, or around a way to *"geocache"* artworks around the city for a gameified way for people to discover local artists.

Eventually, we came up with an idea of a interative digital street signage installation that would display art to everyone passing by. People stopping at our installations could vote or give their opinion on the art and eventually buy merchandise of them to support the artist. You could in a way describe it as public art doomscrolling.

#### process step 4

##### Ideation: Refining the idea  ⚞

Now that we have an idea or at least a direction to focus on, we need to refine our idea. And for that, we need more information. We gathered that by preparing and doing several design methods:

- First, we each conducted interview with experts in different domains that are involved in our current idea. The goal here was to target possible challenges that we could face, gather more intel about the possibility of our concept, and also to evaluate it. For instance, I interviewed the CEO of a Slovakian Digital Signage company with whom I learned several important difficulties behind public digital signage. With these interviews, we narrowed down on our design by integrating the different information we gathered.
- Then, we prepared and handed out *Cultural Probes* to local inhabitants of Seestadt. By doing so, we first established and presented our idea to people that would be affected by it, getting direct feedback from them. But we also collected information about their behaviours, preferences, and habits regarding art, art rating, and also Seestadt.
- Lastly, we created a tabletop game that mimicked the rating interactions we considered at the time. We then hosted games with inhabitants of the neighborhood and observed their behaviours to infer how the rating system impacted their perception of the art.  

Through these methods, we learned a lot about people's preferences, notably their habits in the neighborhood and their prefered way of rating art. All of this helped us develop our concept idea to its final form of this **purely** ideational (and not technical as we largely dismissed the technical feasibility of the project) first phase of the project.

#### process step 5

##### Prototyping: Tuning the idea...  ⚟

We had a concrete, solid idea at the end of the *Ideation* phase. However, we realised that our concept wasn't tangible enough, that the interactions were lacking in providing a memorable experience to users. So we literally went to drawing boards, skteching away ideas of interactions while still mainting the core idea and concept of expanding a free little library with visual local art display and rating possibilities. 

We came up with the ideas of the *special books* upon which the local art was going to be projected. Along those books, an additional tool or object could serve as a controller of some sort, enabling further interactions. Among other things, we thought of pens that could be visually or magnetically tracked to interact with the system and artwork, we thought of adding ropes and pulleys instead of simple buttons to really have a tangible and unique experience while interacting with the app. Finally, we decided to have a hand-sized cube or dice to enable the interactions.

#### process step 6

##### Prototyping: Last checks before takeoff  ⚞

The interactions we came up with worked as follow: 

- First, users had to select one special books (each special book corresponds to different collections of art genres/artists). Then by laying them in the projection area, they could flip through the different artworks of the collections. It should be noted that the books are otherwise blank, meaning that they couldn't be used outside of the system.

- Users could rotate the control dice to select options of the current artwork projected onto the special book. Each face of the cube enabled a different interactions, for a total of 6 possible interactions. Among them was revealing more information about the art/artist, rating the artwork along a scale, expressing the feelings felt along a emotions circle.

To test and refine the idea, we created a physical mock-up and a digital wireframe of the system. By then having students participating in tests, we found several possible issues that we needed to take into account. Ergonomics-wise, the final product/prototype needed to be big enough so that reading through the special books was possible and comfortable. Then, it should be made clear how to use the system as this type of interaction and objects (the special books and control cubes) are not common items.

However, those tests also confirmed the interestingness of the approach, and that we were moving in the right direction.

**INCLUDE PICTURE of mockup/ wireframe**

#### process step 7

##### Prototyping: What would it look like? How do we make it work? ⚞

With the last step, we pretty much confirmed our UX design approach. Now we needed to both work on the visual aspect of the product, basically the UI and business identity of it, but also on the technical aspect of the prototype, how and what we are going to use to make it work.

To make it work, and with the available resources, we used one of our mobile phone, a video projector, a 3D-printed cube and several QR-code stickers. We developped a Kotlin mobile app that would display different screens when shown the different QR-codes on the books or control dice. The phone was connected to video projector to then project those screens onto the book.

I personnally handled the business identity and visual aspect part of our project.Firstly, we very early chose this name “Kunstbibliothek in SeeStadt” because it reflects what our product is in essence. It makes clear what the user will interact with (a library with a focus on art) and where (in Seestadt). Also, this name makes the acronym KISS which makes it stand out and can help people remember about it.

For the logo, we used the acronym KISS to make it. Each letter represents an aspect of our product: 

- The K is a book that is opened toward the other letters. Books are an essential part of any library but it is especially the case with our product since the users will get to experience the artworks through our special books.
- The I is represented by a brush. It symbolizes the art aspect of our product . It is also after the opened book, meaning that the content of the book is art related. A drop of paint is falling from the brush into the next S letters to create the beginning of a movement.
- The two S are drawn fluidly to symbolize water as the lake is the main geographical feature of Seestadt and where it got its name. Contrary to the book and the brush, the two S are more curvy and less edgy, it is like that to represent the boundless and unrestrained aspect of art. The two S are identical so as not to surcharge the image and to have a continuity between those two letters to make it more readable.

Lastly the logo is colored in a gradient of blue. The choice behind this was to reference the Seestadt lake. The gradient was chosen as to not make the logo monotone and also to introduce some movement through color. The color blue also symbolizes seriousness, trust and confidence. We want the artists that collaborate with us to feel those emotions from KISS.

#### process step 8

##### Prototyping: Building the prototype ⚞

Now that we had a really concrete idea of our library, we needed to build a very high fidelity prototype of it.

As we couldn't find an existing shelf of library that we could transform to fit our needs, we decided to build it by ourself. Using my knowledge of laser-cutting machines and tools and materials we had a our disposition, I built and decorated the prototype.

We chose to make the shelf out of wood for eco-friendliness, the availibity of the material, the need to be transported and to be able to easily manufacture it with the laser-cutting machine and the tools we had. We bought premium notebooks and customized them to make our *special books* and to make them seem more like books than simple notebooks. Each book (or collection) has a different color to make them stand out from one another. 
The interactive cube is 3D printed. We used the color blue like in our logo. This will make it stand out in this dark box and also with the white pages. It is decorated with decal stickers for each face to easily symbolize the different interactions.
The outside of the shelf is painted in white with blue marks distributed across the shelf. The white background also makes the logo sticker stand out better. The inside of the projection area is painted in a dark color. This is a technical choice more than an artistic one, as it helps with the projection quality. It also helps with making this area different from the other rows of the would-be shelf that contains the actual books that people could drop off.
The phone and video projector would be situated at the top of the box, hidden and away from the user in a smaller compartment.

Lastly, I also designed additional promotion material such as a poster and flyers to help in drawing in people to discover, understand, and test our prototype.

#### process step 9

##### Prototyping: Testing the prototype ⚞

The final stage of this project was to actually test our prototype and approach0. For that, we set up a stand with our prototype in the streets of Seestadt, close to a supermarket. There we didn't struggle to catch the attention of ongoers and we easily had more than a few participants to test our system.

The tests went along the lines of a [Think-aloud protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol) in the following manner:

- First we introduce the system to the participant, its purpose and how to interact with it.
- Then we ask the participant to interact with the system and to say out loud what they are thinking so that we can record and note what their thought process are.
- While the participant is engaging with the system, we try not to interact with them unless they ask directly or if they are stuck or they stopped using the system but missed an important feature.
- After the participant as gotten the hang of the system and interacted with it for a few minutes, we ask them questions regarding their experience with *KISS* and what they think about it.
- All throughout the process, notes and anonymous recordings are taken.
