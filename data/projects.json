Passersby can still pick up or drop off regular books, but they also have the chance to interact with special art books. These books act as canvases for projected artworks, offering a tangible yet immersive way to experience local creativity. Interaction is further enriched through a hand-sized dice that lets users explore more information about the artworks and artists, express their feelings, and even connect to merchandise opportunities that support local artists financially.",
                    "objective": "This project was conducted as part of a university course focused on Design Thinking. The course encouraged students to develop projects without restrictions on theme, technology, or impact, with the aim of animating and enriching public life in Seestadt (Vienna, Austria). Our team of four chose to support local artists, recognizing both the financial instability of the profession and its vital role in making communities more vibrant and livable. By showcasing art in Seestadt, we sought to bring soul and cultural identity to its newly built streets.",

The project also had to include technology and computers in some way (since it was part of a computer science curriculum) and also that interactions <strong>must</strong> be <em>tangible</em>. This of course gave us a lot of freedom to choose what we could do, but also made it seem like we would not be able to find a good enough theme or idea to start.</p><p>Design thinking is an infinite cycle between expanding the ideas we come up with, then focusing inward and delving deeper onto some of them, then once again expanding on the selected concepts by allowing ourselves more creative freedom before refocusing on a specific idea. I showcase this cycle with little converging/diverging icons on each step.</p><p>Here we were only at the beginning, so we did not restrain our imaginations in producing lots of ideas, many of which were not close to what we eventually did, but that perhaps could have influenced even in a small way our approach or our final design.</p>",

On my side, I primarily focused on art economics and the art market as a whole. Through this research, we found several promising ways to support artists financially, such as through merchandising or, to a lesser extent nowadays, NFTs. We also found that entering the traditional art market is tedious and that only a minority of living artists really profit from it.</p><p>It then became clear to us that this target group and our objective was promising, so we decided to keep it.</p>",

People stopping at our installations could vote or give their opinion on the art and eventually buy merchandise to support the artist.

The goal was to identify potential challenges, gather intel about the feasibility of our concept, and evaluate it. For instance, I interviewed the CEO of a Slovakian Digital Signage company, from whom I learned several important difficulties behind public digital signage. With these interviews, we narrowed down our design by integrating the information we gathered.</li><li>Next, we prepared and handed out <em>Cultural Probes</em> to local inhabitants of Seestadt. This allowed us to present our idea to people who would be affected by it, gaining direct feedback, and to collect information about their behaviors, preferences, and habits regarding art, art rating, and Seestadt itself.</li><li>Lastly, we created a tabletop game mimicking the rating interactions we were considering. We hosted games with inhabitants of the neighborhood and observed their behaviors to understand how the rating system impacted their perception of the art.</li></ul><p>Through these methods, we learned a lot about people's preferences, especially their habits in the neighborhood and their preferred way of rating art.

An additional tool or object could serve as a controller to enable further interactions. We considered pens (visually or magnetically tracked), ropes and pulleys, and finally decided on a hand-sized cube or dice to enable interactions.</p>",

Overall feedback was very positive and highlighted how promising this idea is. Several participants enjoyed the interactions and expressed a desire for such a library to remain in their neighborhood. Most participants handled all interactions well once explained, and most also appreciated the idea of supporting artists, particularly local ones.</p><br/><p>Areas for improvement include using a better, brighter projection device, creating a smaller interaction cube (especially relative to the size of the book), and including more art collections and diverse art genres (as well as actual human-made art, in contrast to the AI-generated art that was used). Additionally, we did not focus on designing and implementing the merchandising aspect of the system, and thus the financial support for artists. If we were to continue this project, the next step would involve applying Design Thinking to create the merchandising flow for users, and a system for artists to sell and submit their work for display.</p><br/><h4 class=\"text-accent_purple text-1xl md:text-2xl font-bold font-spartan\">Personal Reflection</h4><p>I really enjoyed this project and learning about new design methods, especially through practical application. Conducting all of these methods helped me realize how important empathy is when designing for people, as it is the best way to understand what can and should be created. It also opened my eyes to the courage of people who approach strangers on the streets to raise awareness, ask questions, or promote a cause. Capturing people’s attention in this way is far harder than it seems. After this project, I spoke with more of them and gained even greater appreciation for their efforts.</p><br/><p>Finally, as a UX designer and engineer, this project introduced me to the concept of iterative design, and I found myself enjoying it immensely. Of course, there are limitations to everything, and Design Thinking does not eliminate them. In particular, some people follow it strictly like a recipe, but I see it more as a toolbox of suggestions. Nevertheless, my approach to designing and managing projects through structured design phases has definitely evolved and been influenced by the principles of Design Thinking.</p><br/><p>This project has fundamentally shaped how I approach UX and engineering: iterative, empathetic, and adaptable to real user needs.</p>"
